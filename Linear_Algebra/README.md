Basis

Change of basis

That a vector space is a geometric object that doesn’t necessarily have a canonical basis

That a matrix is a linear map between two vector spaces (or from a vector space to itself)
 
What’s singular value decomposition? Why is it useful?

What are orthogonal/orthonormal matrices, and how is changing to an orthonormal basis importantly different from just any change of basis?

What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and what do these tell you about a linear map?
